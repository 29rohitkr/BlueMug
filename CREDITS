I'm much thankful to these long festive holidays we get in India as 
the major portion of this project was completed during this year's
(2018) Diwali holiday season. 

But I'm most grateful to my mommy and daddy, who let me do any sort of
creative work I want and support me in that.

Also, a big thanks to my two young Beta testers - Rounak Singh and Aadya Singh 
for doing valuable validation of BlueMug in terms of functionality, usability, 
reliability, and compatibility.
