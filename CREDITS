I'm much thankful to these long festive holidays we get in India, as 
a major portion of this project was completed during this year's
(2018) Diwali holiday season. 

I'm most grateful to my mommy and daddy, who let me do any sort of
creative work I want to and they wholeheartedly support me in that.

Also, a big thanks to my Beta testers - 
Rounak Singh,
Prashant Raj
Utkarsh Vaibhav
Aadya Singh 
for doing valuable validation of BlueMug BFPE in terms of functionality, usability, 
reliability, and compatibility.
