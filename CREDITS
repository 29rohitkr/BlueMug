I'm much thankful to these long festive holidays we get in India, as 
a major portion of this project was completed during this year's
(2018) Diwali holiday season. 

I'm most grateful to my mommy and daddy, who let me do any sort of
creative work I want to and they wholeheartedly support me in that.

Also, I'm grateful to my Beta testers for this project - 
Rounak Singh,
Prashant Raj
Utkarsh Vaibhav
Aadya Singh 
for doing valuable validation of BlueMug BFPE in terms of functionality, usability, 
reliability, and compatibility.

Finally, I greatly appreciate Don Ho (creator of Notepad++) for creating such an awesome text editor
(It is simply the best editor for all level of coders.)
and MinGW for providing the compiler collection and BinUtils.
