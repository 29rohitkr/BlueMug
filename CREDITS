I'm much thankful to these long festive holidays we get in India, 
as a major portion of this project was completed during this year's(2018) Diwali holidays.

I'm most grateful to my mommy and daddy, who let me do 
any sort of creative work I want to and they wholeheartedly support me in that.

Also, I'm grateful to my Beta testers for this project - 
Rounak Singh,
Utkarsh Vaibhav, and 
Prashant Raj.
for doing valuable validation of BlueMug BFPE in terms of functionality, usability, reliability, and compatibility.

Finally, I greatly appreciate Don Ho (creator of Notepad++) for creating such an awesome source code editor.
and MinGW for providing the compiler collection and BinUtils.
